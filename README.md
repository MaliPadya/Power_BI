## Problem Statement

The VMS (Vendor Management System) Power BI dashboard provides managers with comprehensive insights into their VMS clients. It allows them to track various key metrics related to client requirements, candidate submissions, interviews, and offers. By visualizing this data, managers can make informed decisions and optimize their staffing processes effectively.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Connect Data through Web.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "Arrival Delay".
- Step 5 : Create different types Relationships (Many To Many , Oane to Many)
- Step 6 : Created Vertual Date Column using "CalenderAuto" DAX
- Step 7 : used differend relationship for different calculation according to defined parameter using "USERELATIONSHI" Function
- Step 8 : create Ignore table if i want to ignore some entries
- Step 9 : Create Row Level security For Data Privacy;

[Manager Email] = USERPRINCIPALNAME() ||            
[Sales] = USERPRINCIPALNAME() ||                   
[Master User] = USERPRINCIPALNAME() ||              
[Super User] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()
           
           
In our dataset, Some parameters were assigned value 0, representing those parameters are not applicable for some customers.

All these values have been ignored while calculating average rating for each of the parameters mentioned above.

- Step 12 : In the report view, under the insert tab, two text boxes were added to the canvas, in one of them name of the airlines was mentioned & in the other one company's tagline was written.
- Step 13 : In the report view, under the insert tab, using shapes option from elements group a rectangle was inserted & similarly using image option company's logo was added to the report design area. 
- Step 14 : Calculated column was created in which, customers were grouped into various age groups.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;
       
        Age Group = 
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=25, "0-25 (25 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=50, "25-50 (50 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=75, "50-75 (75 included)",
        
        "75-100 (100 included)")))
        
Snap of new calculated column ,

- Step 15 : New measure was created to find total count of customers.

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
        Count of Customers = COUNT(airline_passenger_satisfaction[ID])
        
A card visual was used to represent count of customers.

 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  % of customers,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
         % Customers = (DIVIDE(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.
 
 Snap of % of customers who preferred business class

 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total distance travelled by flights & a card visual was used to represent total distance.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Total Distance Travelled = SUM(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Flight Distance])
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.

 - Step 18 : The report was then published to Power BI Service.
